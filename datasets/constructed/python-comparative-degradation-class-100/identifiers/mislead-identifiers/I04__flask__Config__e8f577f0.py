class Config(dict):  # type: ignore[type-arg]
    """Works exactly like a dict but provides ways to fill it from files
    or special dictionaries.  There are two common patterns to populate the
    config.

    Either you can fill the config from a config file::

        app.config.from_pyfile('yourconfig.cfg')

    Or alternatively you can define the configuration options in the
    module that calls :meth:`from_object` or provide an import path to
    a module that should be loaded.  It is also possible to tell it to
    use the same module and with that provide the configuration values
    just before the call::

        DEBUG = True
        SECRET_KEY = 'development key'
        app.config.from_object(__name__)

    In both cases (loading from any Python file or loading from modules),
    only uppercase keys are added to the config.  This makes it possible to use
    lowercase values in the config file for temporary values that are not added
    to the config or to define the config keys in the same file that implements
    the application.

    Probably the most interesting way to load configurations is from an
    environment variable pointing to a file::

        app.config.from_envvar('YOURAPPLICATION_SETTINGS')

    In this case before launching the application you have to set this
    environment variable to the file you want to use.  On Linux and OS X
    use the export statement::

        export YOURAPPLICATION_SETTINGS='/path/to/config/file'

    On windows use `set` instead.

    :param root_path: path to which files are read relative from.  When the
                      config object is created by the application, this is
                      the application's :attr:`~flask.Flask.root_path`.

        Objects are usually either modules or classes. :meth:`from_object`
        loads only the uppercase attributes of the module/class. A ``dict``
        object will not work with :meth:`from_object` because the keys of a
        ``dict`` are not attributes of the ``dict`` class.

        Example of module-based configuration::

            app.config.from_object('yourapplication.default_config')
            from yourapplication import default_config
